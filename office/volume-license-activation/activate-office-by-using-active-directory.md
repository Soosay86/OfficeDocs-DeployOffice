# Activate volume licensed versions of Office by using Active Directory

***Applies to:*** *Volume licensed versions of Office Long Term Service Channel (LTSC) 2024, Office LTSC 2021, Office 2019, and Office 2016 (including Project and Visio)*
  
Active Directory-based activation enables an organization to activate volume licensed versions of Office, including Project and Visio, on computers that are joined to an Active Directory domain. Active Directory-based activation is implemented as a role service on Windows Server and relies on Active Directory Domain Services to store an activation object. For more information, see [Activate using Active Directory-based activation](/windows/deployment/volume-activation/activate-using-active-directory-based-activation-client).

## Requirements for using Active Directory-based activation

To activate through Active Directory, install the volume licensed version of Office, Project, or Visio with a Generic Volume License Key (GVLK) on one of these operating systems:

- Windows 11
- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012  

Review the [System requirements for Office](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/5e59b928-c35c-4b7f-806d-8b44c23d2eb9) to determine which operating systems are supported by the volume licensed version of Office, Project, or Visio that you're deploying to users in your organization.

## Configure Active Directory-based activation

To configure Active Directory-based activation, you must have Domain Administrator and Enterprise Administrator credentials.

1. Sign in to a domain controller in Active Directory and use Server Manager to install the Volume Activation Services role.
2. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and navigate to the **Billing** > [Your products](https://admin.cloud.microsoft/?#/subscriptions) page.
3. Select the **Volume licensing** tab. (You need to be a volume licensing administrator to access this section.)

4. Go to the **Download and keys** tab and get your KMS key for your version of Office.
5. Download the appropriate Office Volume License Pack from the Microsoft Download Center:
    - [Office LTSC 2024 Volume License Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=106246)
    - [Office LTSC 2021 Volume License Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=103446)
    - [Office 2019 Volume License Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57342)
    - [Office 2016 Volume License Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49164)
1. Run the Office Volume License Pack executable file. This installs the Office Volume License Pack and opens the **Volume Activation Tools** wizard.
1. Choose **Next**, and then on the **Select Volume Activation Method** page, choose **Active Directory-Based Activation**.
1. On the **Manage Activation Objects** page, enter the KMS host key and (optional) give it a name. Then choose **Next**.
1. On the **Activate Product** page, either activate the KMS host key online or by phone, and then follow the rest of the wizard instructions.

When you're done, an **Activation Succeeded** page displays.

## Additional information about Active Directory-based activation

- Active Directory-based activation uses the same keys that are used by Key Management Service (KMS). However, Active Directory-based activation doesn't require a dedicated KMS host computer. The activation object is replicated across all the domain controllers in the Active Directory forest.
- A successful Active Directory-based activation of Office lasts for up to 180 days. The Software Protection service running on the computer periodically attempts to re-activate Office by querying Active Directory for the activation object. If Active Directory can't be contacted, Office tries to activate by using a discoverable KMS host computer.
