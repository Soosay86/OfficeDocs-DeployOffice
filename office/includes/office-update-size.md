The size of the updates downloaded to the user's device from the update location varies depending on several factors, including how long it’s been since Office was last updated and the number of security and quality updates available.

To minimize the size of the updates that need to be downloaded, we recommend keeping Office up to date. Office uses a technology called binary delta compression to help reduce the size of updates applied to the user's device. However, binary delta compression is only available if you're updating from a recent version of Office. For example, if you're updating from the September or October version to the November version. But if you're updating a much older version of Office, such as from the June to November version, binary delta compression isn’t available.
