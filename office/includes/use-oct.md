> [!TIP]
> - Use the [Office Customization Tool (OCT)](https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings) instead of a text editor to create your configuration.xml file. 
> - The OCT simplifies creating and customizing your configuration.xml file through a web-based interface that allows you to easily make selections for use with the Office Deployment Tool. For more information, see [Overview of the Office Customization Tool](/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-office-customization-tool).
> - Note that this OCT is different from the Office Customization Tool previously used to install volume licensed versions of Office that used Windows Installer (MSI) as the installation technology.
