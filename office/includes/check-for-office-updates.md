Instead of waiting for the scheduled task to run to check for updates, you can manually check for updates. To do that, open any Office app, such as Word, and go to **File** > **Account** > **Update Options** > **Update Now**.

This causes the Click-to-Run service to go look for updates at the location that youâ€™ve configured Office to look for updates. For example, directly from the Office CDN on the internet. If updates are available, Office begins the process to download.
