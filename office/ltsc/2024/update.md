# Update Office LTSC 2024

Once you deploy Office LTSC 2024, including Project 2024 and Visio 2024, it's important to keep it up to date. Microsoft regularly releases security updates and quality improvements, including updates that enhance stability and performance. Office LTSC 2024 typically receives updates once a month on the second Tuesday.

> [!NOTE]
> Office LTSC 2024 doesn't receive new features after it's released. To access new Office features on an ongoing basis, consider transitioning to a Microsoft 365 plan that includes Office.

## How updates are different in Office LTSC 2024

Updates in Office LTSC 2024 are managed the same as in Office LTSC 2021 but differ significantly from MSI-based updates used in Office 2016. In Office LTSC 2024, updates are cumulative, meaning the latest version available on the Office CDN includes all previous security and quality updates. This approach ensures that Office is up to date when you download and install it from the Office CDN, so you donâ€™t need to apply individual updates or service packs.

Unlike in earlier MSI-based versions, there are no separate downloads for security or quality updates; they're included in each new build posted on the Office CDN. As a result, Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) isn't used by itself to update Office LTSC 2024. However, Microsoft Configuration Manager can be used to manage how and when updates are applied, and where they're sourced from.

## Update channel for Office LTSC 2024

Office uses the concept of update channels to determine which updates an installed version of Office receives. The update channel is a device-wide setting, meaning all Office products, including Project and Visio, installed on a device must use the same update channel.

"PerpetualVL2024" is the **only** update channel available for Office LTSC Professional Plus 2024 and Office LTSC Standard 2024. The PerpetualVL2024 update channel is also available for volume licensed versions of Project 2024 and Visio LTSC 2024.

Volume licensed versions of Project 2024 and Visio LTSC 2024 can also use other update channels, such as Current Channel, Monthly Enterprise Channel, or Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel. The reason Project and Visio can use these other update channels is to ensure compatibility when installed on a device alongside Microsoft 365 Apps, which support all these channels. Even if Project and Visio use different update channels, they only receive security and quality updates each month, without any new features.

For more information, see [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps](/microsoft-365-apps/updates/overview-update-channels).
