# Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services

The following table lists the Office versions that are supported for connecting to Microsoft 365 services. For example, connecting to Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, or OneDrive.

| Office version         | Supported for connecting until this date  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft 365 Apps      | Supported as long as you’re using a [supported version](/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date#supported-versions). |
| Office LTSC 2024        | October 9<sup>th</sup>, 2029             |
| Office LTSC 2021        | October 13<sup>th</sup>, 2026             |

> [!NOTE]
> - Support for connection to Microsoft 365 services with Office 2019 and Office 2016 ended on October 10, 2023. 
> - As stated in a [April 2017 blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2017/04/20/office-365-proplus-updates/), only perpetual Office versions in mainstream support are supported for connecting to Microsoft 365 services. Office 2016 is now out of mainstream support, but its coverage was extended until October 2023, as stated in a [September 2018 blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2018/09/06/helping-customers-shift-to-a-modern-desktop/).

## Older Office versions not supported for connecting to Microsoft 365 services

Older Office versions might still be able to connect to Microsoft 365 services, but that connectivity isn't supported.

In practical terms, what this means is that older Office versions might not be able to use all the latest functionality and features of Microsoft 365 services. In addition, over time, these older versions might encounter other unexpected performance or reliability issues while using Microsoft 365 services. This situation occurs because improvements to Microsoft 365 services don't consider or test compatibility with these older Office versions.

No active measures are made to block older Office versions from connecting to Microsoft 365 services if they're in extended support and are kept up to date. For example, Office 2019 and Office 2016, both of which are in extended support until October 14, 2025.

Therefore, to provide the best experience with using Microsoft 365 services, we strongly recommend that you move off older Office versions to versions supported for connecting to Microsoft 365 services.

## Upgrade resources available to administrators

We recommend that you upgrade older Office clients to a subscription version of the Office client, such as Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. The most up-to-date subscription versions of the Office client are always supported connecting to Microsoft 365 services.

We provide various services to help you upgrade to subscription versions of the Office client. The following list provides some examples of resources that are available:

- [Microsoft FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack), for migration and deployment assistance from Microsoft experts.
- [App Assure](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365/app-assure), for assistance from Microsoft with application compatibility issues.
- [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](../deploy/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps.md), for technical documentation.
- [Product lifecycle dashboard](/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/asset-intelligence/product-lifecycle-dashboard) and [upgrade readiness dashboard](/mem/configmgr/sum/deploy-use/office-365-dashboard#bkmk_o365_readiness), for users of Microsoft Configuration Manager (current branch).
