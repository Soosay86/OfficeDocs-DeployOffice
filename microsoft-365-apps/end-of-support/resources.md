## Resources to help you upgrade Office

We recommend that you upgrade older Office clients to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. If that's not possible, we recommend that you upgrade to [Office Long Term Service Channel (LTSC) 2024](/office/ltsc/2024/overview), which is the most current version of Office available through volume licensing.

We provide various services to help you upgrade to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. The following list provides some examples of resources that are available:

- [Microsoft FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack), for migration and deployment assistance from Microsoft experts.
- [App Assure](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365/app-assure), for assistance from Microsoft with application compatibility issues.
- [Deployment guide for Microsoft 365 Apps](../deploy/deployment-guide-microsoft-365-apps.md), for technical documentation.
