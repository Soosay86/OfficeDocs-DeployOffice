# Windows Server end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. These issues could include new features added to Microsoft 365 Apps, or updates to existing features, not working as expected.

The [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern) governs Microsoft 365, requiring customers to stay current with the servicing and [system requirements](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/13eda659-3dfc-448e-b2cd-70ebb989be47) for the product or service. This policy requires customers to use Microsoft 365 Apps on a Windows operating system that is currently in support.

If your organization is using a version of Windows Server that doesn't support Microsoft 365 Apps, we recommend that you move to [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365) or [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-desktop/).
