# Configuring Preferences for Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) in Microsoft 365 Enterprise

As an admin for Microsoft 365 Enterprise, you can tailor Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) preferences to meet the diverse needs of your users. This article provides an overview of preferences for MAU and helps you understand the documented preferences available.

## What are Preferences for MAU?

Preferences for MAU are settings that allow you to customize the behavior of Microsoft AutoUpdate, which is responsible for keeping Microsoft 365 applications up-to-date. By setting these preferences, you manage update frequency and channels, ensuring users receive the latest features and security updates with minimal disruptions.

For more detailed information on preferences and their deployment, see [Deploy preferences for Office for Mac](../mac/deploy-preferences-for-office-for-mac.md).

## IgnoreUIOpenAfterInstall

Determines whether the MAU GUI launches after installation or an update. IT admins can use this setting to prevent users from seeing the MAU GUI after an update.

| Category        | Details |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Domain          | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type            | Boolean |
| Default Value   | FALSE |
| Manageable      | Yes |
| Accepted Values | TRUE / FALSE / 1 / 0 |
| Comments        | When set to TRUE, the MAU GUI doesn't launch after installation or an update.<br><br>Note: This setting doesn't prevent MAU GUI from launching as a result of finding updates in AutomaticCheck mode. |

## AcknowledgedDataCollectionPolicy

Stores user's choice on data collection policy acknowledgment. This policy helps ensure that users are aware of the data collection policies in place.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type | String |
| Default Value | |
| Manageable | Yes |
| Accepted Values | RequiredDataOnly |
| Comments | Not setting or incorrectly setting this preference leads to Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU):<br><ul><li>Repeatedly showing Data Collection policy</li><li>Not offering updates.</li></ul> |

> [!NOTE] 
> RequiredAndOptionalData is now deprecated. MAU never used RequiredAndOptionalData and only used RequiredDataOnly for preferences. This preference is now removed.

## HowToCheck

Specifies how Microsoft AutoUpdate checks for updates.

| Category        | Details |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Domain          | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type            | String |
| Default Value   | AutomaticDownload |
| Manageable      | Yes |
| Accepted Values | AutomaticDownload<br>AutomaticCheck<br>Manual |
| Comments        | Not having this entry, or having an invalid entry reverts MAU to the default 'AutomaticDownload' mode.<br><br>AutomaticDownload – MAU checks for updates on regular intervals and push updates automatically. Indication an app needs to close in order to complete the update is displayed either in app, or via notification.<br><br>AutomaticCheck – MAU regularly checks for updates and launches the GUI when it detects an available update. The user initiates the update sequence from the GUI.<br>Manual - MAU checks only for its own updates, not for other updates. This option is removed from GUI. Setting to Manual results in MAU not offering updates automatically. The following value is deprecated: <ul><li>Automatic – replaced by AutomaticCheck</li></ul><br> Setting to Manual results in MAU not offering updates automatically. |

## ChannelName

ChannelName specifies which update channel Microsoft AutoUpdate receives updates from.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type | String |
| Default Value | Current |
| Manageable | Yes |
| Accepted Values | Beta<br>Current<br>CurrentThrottle<br>Custom<br>Preview |
| Comments | Not having this entry, or having an invalid entry in ChannelName, reverts MAU to the default 'Current' channel.<br>Following values are deprecated and should no longer be used:<br><ul><li>External (replaced by Preview)</li><li>InsiderFast (replaced by Beta)</li><li>Production (replaced by Current)</li></ul>Note: The "Custom" setting is designed to help organizations host updates internally, reducing external network traffic. In this scenario, the IT Administrator is responsible for:<br><ul><li>Manage server space within the organization</li><li>Downloading manifests to specified manifest server location</li><li>Downloading update packages to specified update cache location (if applicable)</li></ul><br><strong>Notes on Channels:</strong><ul><li>Current – This channel distributes all official releases and is the default setting.</li><li>CurrentThrottle – Created to allow people to skip "weekly" Outlook releases in Current channel. Other apps are updated through Current channel (default).</li><li>Custom – Channel to be used if internal servers are to be utilized.</li><li>Preview – This channel provides a preview of official releases. Microsoft 365 apps are typically available two weeks before the official release.</li><li>Beta – Absolute latest in development. Microsoft 365 apps are updated two times a week. Only to be used for testing and error reporting purposes. Product support might not be available in this channel.</li></ul><br>For more information about Preview and Beta channels, see [Compare Microsoft 365 Insider channels](../insider/compare-channels.md) and [Let Mac users choose Microsoft 365 Insider for themselves by using Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU)](../insider/deploy/microsoft-autoupdate.md). |

<strong>Note on Per-App channel</strong>:
You can specify a ChannelName for each app by adding a ChannelName key and value to the specific application that requires a different channel. For example, the following XML snippet shows how to set the channel for Excel to be Current, and everything else to be Beta:
```xml
<key>Applications</key>
<dict>  
        <key>/Applications/Microsoft Excel.app</key>
        <dict>  
                <key>Application ID</key>
                <string>XCEL2019</string>
                <key>ChannelName</key>
                <string>Current</string>
        </dict>
      ......
</dict>
<key>ChannelName</key>
<string>Beta</string>
```

## ManifestServer

The ManifestServer is the URL for the server hosting update manifests. MAU downloads update manifests from this location when ChannelName is set to Custom.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type | String |
| Default Value | |
| Manageable | Yes |
| Comments | Must point to a valid URL hosting update manifest files. List of files to be hosted are:<br><ul><li>.xml</li><li>-chk.xml</li><li>.cat</li><li>-history.xml</li></ul>Note:<br><ul><li>ChannelName should be set to Custom in order to make meaningful use of this preference.</li><li>If ChannelName is set to Custom and this preference isn't configured, MAU defaults to Current channel. The latest published manifest files can be accessed at the following URL, which serves as the root URL for Current channel: ``https://officecdnmac.microsoft.com/pr/C1297A47-86C4-4C1F-97FA-950631F94777/MacAutoupdate/`` <br>Append the actual file name to the URL provided; the URL doesn't include a directory listing.</li></ul>When populating ManifestServer, ensure ALL collaterals are copied, including following files for each of the apps:<br><ul><li>.xml</li><li>-chk.xml</li><li>.cat</li><li>-history.xml</li></ul>Also, make sure to copy all versioned manifests. Versions are listed in –history.xml file, and the file names (.xml, .cat) need to be constructed with 4090&lt;AppID&gt;_&lt;Version&gt;.[xml &vert; cat], otherwise some of the functionalities provided by MAU might not be available. |

## UpdateCache

URL for the server hosting actual update packages. MAU downloads update packages from this location instead of the location specified in the .xml manifest file.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type | String |
| Default Value | |
| Manageable | Yes |
| Comments | Set UpdateCache to direct client traffic to an internal update server, reducing high external download traffic.<br>If the correct update package isn't at this location, a 'Download Error' is reported.<br>To populate UpdateCache, copy all updater packages. You can find these packages by examining the contents of .xml files for each application, such as 0409MSWD2019.xml from Current channel. |

## EnableFallbackChannel

Allows Microsoft AutoUpdate to look for updates in Current channel if the specified channel (Beta, Preview, Custom) doesn't have manifests for the registered applications available.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type | Boolean |
| Default Value | TRUE |
| Manageable | Yes |
| Accepted Values | TRUE / FALSE / 1 / 0 |
| Comments | EnableFallbackChannel is useful if you set up ManifestServer location but fail to copy manifests for all the registered applications. Set this preference to FALSE if you don't want to use Current channel as a backup. |


## DisableOptInNotification

When Set to TRUE, prevents Opt-In notification/pop-up window from showing even when HowToCheck is set to Automatic.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | com.microsoft.autoupdate2 |
| Type | Boolean |
| Default Value | FALSE |
| Manageable | Yes |
| Accepted Values | TRUE / FALSE / 1 / 0 |

| Comments | Use this preference if your organization uses a security app that modifies installed apps. An indication to suspect a security app modifying the installed app would be frequent update failures resulting in full updater downloads for all Microsoft 365 apps. Office app updates come through as "binary delta" updates, where only changed bits are updated. Having a security app that modifies the actual installed application will cause verification failure after each binary delta update, forcing a full updater package download. One can tell if the app was modified by running the following verification from the terminal app. This fails if the integrity of the application is compromised:<br> `codesign –vv --deep <<path to the app>>` |
