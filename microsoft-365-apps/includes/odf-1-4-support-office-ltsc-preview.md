The preview also includes support for OpenDocument Format (ODF) 1.4 in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. With this change, ODF files are saved in the ODF 1.4 format by default. ODF 1.4 introduces several new features, such as tables within shapes, lists starting at zero, and new accessibility attributes for decorative objects. Previous versions of ODF files can still be opened but are saved as ODF 1.4.
